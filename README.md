In the summer after my first semester on the Fontys ICT bachelor,
I made a remote control Arduino car including my own Bluetooth Android controller app.

The Arduino used a motor shield to control the motors. 
An HC-05 Bluetooth module is used to receive Bluetooth messages and gives them
over serial to the Arduino.
